Quick Start Guide
*****************

This guide is intended to get you up and running with a mininmum of
configuration.  Once you get django_elves working, you may want to
look at the full configuration options.

1. Add the following setting to your ``settings.py``:

      COMPILED_PATH = '/(ABSOLUTE_PATH)...'

   Path to an empty directory.  Your sprite definitions will each be
   compiled into a layout, and cached in a python file in this
   directory. It is recommeded to set this to something like:

      COMPILED_PATH = '/YOUR_DJANGO_PROJECT_DIR/sprites'

2. Make sure that any css files you need to serve are rendered as
   django templates.  A basic view has been provided, called
   *serve_rendered*, to aid with development. You really only want to
   render css files if possible, so the urlpatterns entry would look
   like:

      urlpatterns = patterns('',
          ...
          (r'^site_media/(?P<path>.*\.css)$', 'django_elves.views.simple.serve_rendered',
           {'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT}),
       ...
      )

3. Create an empty file in the root of your project directory, called
   ``sprites.py``.  This is where you will defined which images are
   grouped together in sprites.

4. Run the management command

   **manage.py elves_check**

   and fix any errors that it shows.  You will probably have to create
   the directory ``autosprites`` within your settings.MEDIA_ROOT
   directory.

5. Define your sprites.  Here is an example sprite file:

      from django_elves.compiler import *

      class icons(Sprite):
          direction = VERTICAL
          # default padding -- (10, 0) would also work,
          # as it has CSS-style defaults
          padding = (10, 0, 10, 0)
          # this means that within 10 pixels to the top and bottom of each sprite,
          # there will be nothing but transparent pixels (or the edge of the image).

          images = [
              Image('icons/smiley1.png'),
              Image('icons/smiley2.png'),
              Image('icons/smiley3.png'),
              Image('icons/frown.png', padding=(12, 0)), # different padding
              ]

      class box_sprite(Sprite):
          direction = HORIZONTAL

          images = [
              OpenImage('box_top.png', open_side=BOTTOM),
              RepeatedImage('box_mid.png'),
              OpenImage('box_bottom.png', open_side=TOP),
              ]
